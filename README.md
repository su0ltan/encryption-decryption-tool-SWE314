# Educational Encryption/Decryption Tool

This Java project, developed during a security course, serves as an educational tool for exploring various encryption and decryption algorithms. The project is standalone, requiring no external API for use.

## Overview

The Educational Encryption/Decryption Tool provides implementations of different encryption and decryption algorithms to enhance understanding in the field of cryptography.

## Implemented Algorithms

### 1. Main
- Description: The main class serves as the entry point for the program, demonstrating the usage of different encryption and decryption algorithms.

### 2. Monoalphabetic
- Description: Implements the monoalphabetic substitution cipher, which replaces each letter in the plaintext with a corresponding letter from the cipher alphabet.

### 3. Playfair
- Description: Implements the Playfair cipher, a polygraphic substitution cipher that encrypts and decrypts pairs of letters.

### 4. KeyedTransposition
- Description: Implements the keyed transposition cipher, which rearranges the letters of the plaintext according to a secret key.

### 5. KeyedTransposition (bit level)
- Description: Implements the keyed transposition cipher at the bit level, rearranging the letters of the plaintext according to a secret key.

### 6. Vigenere
- Description: Implements the Vigen√®re cipher, a method of encrypting alphabetic text using a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution.
