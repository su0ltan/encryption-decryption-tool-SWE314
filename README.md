# Educational Encryption/Decryption tool

This Java project provides educational implementations of various encryption and decryption algorithms. It includes the following classes:

- Main: The main class that serves as the entry point for the program. It demonstrates the usage of different encryption and decryption algorithms.

- Monoalphabetic: Implements the monoalphabetic substitution cipher, which replaces each letter in the plaintext with a corresponding letter from the cipher alphabet.

- Playfair: Implements the Playfair cipher, a polygraphic substitution cipher that encrypts and decrypts pairs of letters.

- KeyedTransposition: Implements the keyed transposition cipher, which rearranges the letters of the plaintext according to a secret key.

- KeyedTransposition (bit level): Implements the keyed transposition cipher, which rearranges the letters of the plaintext according to a secret key.

- Vigenere: Implements the Vigen√®re cipher.
